a text file for practicing how to use git

2nd note: my first push went wrong because in GitHub it said to git push -u origin main, but the main should be master not main since that is how your branch is called. I still run into a new problem though. 

Still running into a problem with email privacy settings.

I think the main problem was I have my settings on my GitHub where my personal email should not be exposed when i make commits. For obvious reasons. But I was able to use the noreply email provided by git hub and follow the steps from stack overflow

So notes to know for the future:
cd - change directory
mkdir - make new folder
git init - initialize git repository
git add - add stuff to the staging area, with either file name or .
git status - check status in staging area
git commit -m "<message>" - big changes commits

git checkout -b new_branch - make and go to new_branch
git checkout master - go back to master branch
git merge master - merge all changes from master to current branch
